Overview
--------

The Java module installs the JDK and JRE.


Module Description
-------------------

The Java module allows Puppet to install the JDK/JRE and update the bashrc file to include java in the path. 

Setup
-----

**What java affects:**

* installation directory for java
* bashrc file of the user or /etc/bashrc if parameter pathfile is not set 
	
### Beginning with Java

To deploy JDK-6u35-x64 to /home/example.com/apps/jdk-6u35 and append JAVA_HOME to $PATH

    java::setup { "example.com-jdk_6u35":
      ensure        => 'present',
      source        => 'jdk-6u35-linux-x64.tar.gz',
      deploymentdir => '/home/example.com/apps/jdk-6u35',
      user          => 'example.com',
      pathfile      => '/home/example.com/.bashrc'
    }

Usage
------

The `java::setup` resource definition has several parameters to assist installation of java.

**Parameters within `java`**

####`ensure`

This parameter specifies whether java should be deployed to the deployment directory and bashrc file is updated or not.
Valid arguments are "present" or "absent". Default 


####`source`

This parameter specifies the source for the java archive. 
This file must be in the files directory in the caller module. 
**Only .tar.gz and .gz source archives are supported.**

####`deploymentdir`

This parameter specifies the directory where java will be installed.

Note: If deploymentdir is set to /usr/local/, and you want to remove this installation in the future, setting ensure => 'absent' will cause the entire directory, i. e. /usr/local/ to be deleted permanently.

####`user`

This parameter is used to set the permissions for the installation directory of java.

####`pathfile`

This parameter is used to find and update the bashrc file to include java in the environment path.
